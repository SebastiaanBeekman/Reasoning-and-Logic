\solution We use the predicates $\textit{Ball}(x)$ for $x$ is a ball and $\textit{Have}(x,y)$ for $x$ must have $y$. We also use a constant $\textit{you}$ to represent you.
\[
	\exists x (\textit{Ball}(x) \AND \forall y (x \neq y \IMP \NOT \textit{Ball}(y)) \AND \textit{Have}(\textit{you}, x))
\]

\solution Using the predicates $\textit{Person}(x)$ for $x$ is a person, $\textit{Question}(x)$ for $x$ is a question, $\textit{Answer}(x)$ for $x$ is an answer, and $\textit{Has}(x,y)$ for $x$ has $y$.
Two different interpretations are:
\[
	\exists x (\textit{Person}(x) \AND \forall y (\textit{Question}(y) \IMP (\exists z (\textit{Answer}(z) \AND \textit{Has}(x,z)))))
\]
In other words, there is a single person who has the answers to all questions. 
\[
	\forall x (\textit{Question}(x) \IMP \exists y \exists z (\textit{Person}(y) \AND \textit{Answer}(z) \AND \textit{Has}(y,z)))
\]
In other words, every question has an answer and some person knows it (but different people might know the answer to different questions).
