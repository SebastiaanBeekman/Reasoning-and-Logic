	\solution It is not. Take for example $p=q=0$. In this case $\NOT(p \IFF q)$ is false, but $(\NOT p) \IFF (\NOT q)$ is true. Try to see if you can find a more simplified expression that $(\NOT p) \IFF (\NOT q)$ is equivalent to.

	\solution Verify the following answers with truth tables yourself!
	\sparts{
		q \IMP p &
		\F &
		\NOT p \cr
		\NOT p \AND q &
		\T &
		q
	}
	\solution When translating try make the English sentences flow a bit without adding in more constraints. For example by using the word `but' rather than `and' in two of the examples below.
	\spart
		It is not sunny or it is not cold.
	\spart
		I will have neither stroopwafels nor appeltaart.
	\spart
		It is Tuesday today, but this is not Belgium.
