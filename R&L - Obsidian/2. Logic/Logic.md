# Logic
## Introduction
We know a lot more about logic that we realise, because everything that we know has *logical* consequences that follow automatically. If you know that all humans are mortal, and you know that Socrates is human, then in a sense you know that Socrates is mortal, whether or not you have ever considered or wanted to consider that fact. This is an example of [[logical deduction]]: from the [[premise|premises]] that "All humans are mortal" and "Socrates is human", the [[conclusion]] that "Socrates is mortal" can be deducted by logic.

Among the fundamental elements of thought, and therefore of logic, are propositions. A [[proposition]] is a statement that it is either true or false. “Delft is a city” and “2 + 2 = 42” are propositions. In English, a proposition is expressed as a sentence, and sentences have parts. A simple sentence like “Delft is a city” has a [[subject]] and a [[predicate]]:
- Subject: Delft
- Is a city: predicate

Once we start working with predicates, we can create propositions using [[quantifier|quantifiers]] like ‘all’, ‘some’ and ‘no’. For example, working with the predicate ‘has a university’ we can move from simple propositions like “Delft has a university” to “All cities have a university” or to “No city has a university” or to the rather more realistic “Some cities have a university”.
