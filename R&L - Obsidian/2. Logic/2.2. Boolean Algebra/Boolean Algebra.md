# Boolean Algebra
The algebra of numbers includes a large number of rules for manipulating expressions. The distributive law, for example, says that x(y + z) = xy+xz, where x, y, and z are variables that stand for any numbers or numerical expressions. This law means that whenever you see something of the form xy+ xz in a numerical expression, you can substitute x(y+z) without changing the value of the expression, and *vice versa*. Note that the equals sign in x(y + z) = xy + xz means “has the same value as, no matter what numerical values x, y, and z have”. 

In Boolean algebra, we work with logical values instead of numerical values. There are only two logical values, true and false. We will write these values as **T** and **F** or 1 and 0. The symbols **T** and **F** play a similar role in Boolean algebra to the role that constant numbers such as 1 and 3.14159 play in ordinary algebra. Instead of the equals sign, Boolean algebra uses logical equivalence, $\equiv$, which has essentially the same meaning. For example, for propositions p, q, and r, the $\equiv$ operator in p ∧ (q $\wedge$ r) $\equiv$ (p $\wedge$ q) $\wedge$ r means “has the same value as, no matter what logical values p, q, and r have”.
