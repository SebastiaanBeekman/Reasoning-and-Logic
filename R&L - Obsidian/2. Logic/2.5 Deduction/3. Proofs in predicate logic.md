# Proofs in predicate logic
One of the most basic rules of deduction in predicate logic says that ($\forall$xP(x)) $\Rightarrow$ P(a) for any entity a in the domain of discourse of the predicate P. That is, if a predicate is true of all entities, then it is true of any given particular entity. This rule can be combined with rules of deduction for propositional logic to give the following valid arguments:

These valid arguments go by the names of [[modus ponens]] and [[modus tollens]] for predicate logic. Note that from the premise $\forall$x(P(x) $\rightarrow$ Q(x)) we can deduce P(a) $\rightarrow$ Q(a). From this and from the premise that P(a), we can deduce Q(a) by [[modus ponens]]. So the first argument above is valid. The second argument is similar, using [[modus tollens]].

The most famous logical deduction of them all is an application of modus ponens for predicate logic:
- All humands are mortal
- Socrates is human
- $\therefore$ Socrates is mortal

This has the form of [[modus ponens]] with P(x) standing for “x is human”, Q(x) standing for “x is mortal”, and a standing for the noted entity, Socrates.

To disprove validity of arguments in predicate logic, you again need to provide a counterexample. These are most easily given in the form of a mathematical structure. Consider for instance the following argument:
- $\exists$xP(x)
- $\forall$x(P(x) $\rightarrow$ Q(x))
- $\therefore$ $\forall$xQ(x)

This argument is not valid and we can prove that using the following structure *A*.
- $D$ = {a, b}
- $P^A$ = {a}
- $Q^A$ = {a}

As you can see, the first premise is true. There is an x such that P(x) holds, namely x = a. The second premise is also true, as for all x for which P(x) holds (so only x = a), Q(x) also holds (and indeed Q(a)) holds. However the conclusion is false, as Q(b) does not hold, so the Q(x) does not hold for all x.
