# Classifying propositions
Certain types of proposition will play a special role in our further work with logic. In particular, we define tautologies, contradictions, and contingencies as follows:

### Definition 2.4
- A compound proposition is said to be a [[tautology]] if and only if it is *true* for all possible combinations of truth values of the propositional variables which it contains (conclusion is *true* no matter what)
- A compound proposition is said to be a [[contradiction]] if and only if it is *false* for all possible combinations of truth values of the propositional variables which it contains (conclusion is *false* no matter what)
- A compound proposition is said to be a [[contingency]] if and only if it is neither a tautology nor a contradiction.

| p   | q   | p ∨ q | ¬q  | (p ∨ q) ∧ ¬q | ((p ∨ q) ∧ ¬q) → p |
| --- | --- | ----- | --- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| 0   | 0   | 0     | 1   | 0            | 1                  |
| 0   | 1   | 1     | 0   | 0            | 1                  |
| 1   | 0   | 1     | 1   | 1            | 1                  |
| 1   | 1   | 1     | 0   | 0            | 1                  | 

The fact that all entries in the last column are true tells us that this expression is a tautology. Note that for any compound proposition P, P is a tautology if and only if $\neg$P is a contradiction. Logical equivalence can be defined in terms of tautology:

### Definition 2.5
Two compound propositions, P and Q, are said to be [[logically equivalent]] if and only if the proposition P $\leftrightarrow$ Q is a tautology.

The assertion that P is logically equivalent to Q will be expressed symbolically as ‘P $\equiv$ Q’. For example, (p $\rightarrow$ q) $\equiv$ ($\neg$p $\vee$ q), and p ⊕ q $\equiv$ (p $\vee$ q) ∧ $\neg$(p $\wedge$ q).
