# Propositional Logic
## Introduction
We humans use a [[natural language]] when we speak, such as Dutch, English or Flemish. Natural languages are ambiguous and often vague. To start modelling them we first consider **propositional logic**. This form of logic is arguably the easiest to work with, but also has limited expressive power. However even with this form we can already encapsulate many arguments and power a number of applications, for instance digital logic in chip design.
