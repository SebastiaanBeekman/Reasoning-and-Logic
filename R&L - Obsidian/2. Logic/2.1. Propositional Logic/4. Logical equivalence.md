# Logical equivalence
Suppose we want to verify that, in fact, (p $\wedge$  q) $\wedge$  r and p $\wedge$  (q $\wedge$  r) do always have the same value. To do so, we have to consider all possible combinations of values of p, q, and r, and check that for all such combinations, the two compound expressions do indeed have the same value.It is convenient to organize this computation into a truth table. A [[truth table]] is a table that shows the value of one or more compound propositions for each possible combination of values of the propositional variables that they contain. We call each such combination a [[truth table situation|situation]]. The table below is a truth table that compares the value of (p $\wedge$  q) $\wedge$  r to the value of p $\wedge$  (q $\wedge$  r) for all possible values of p, q, and r. There are eight rows in the table because there are exactly eight different ways in which truth values can be assigned to p, q, and r. In this table, we see that the last two columns, representing the values of (p $\wedge$  q) $\wedge$  r and p $\wedge$  (q $\wedge$  r), are identical.

| p   | q   | r   | p ∧ q | q ∧ r | (p ∧ q) ∧ r | p ∧ (q ∧ r) |
| --- | --- | --- | ----- | ----- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0     | 0     | 0           | 0           |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 0     | 0     | 0           | 0           |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 0     | 0     | 0           | 0           |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 0     | 1     | 0           | 0           |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 0     | 0     | 0           | 0           |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 0     | 0     | 0           | 0           |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 1     | 0     | 0           | 0           |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1     | 1     | 1           | 1           |

More generally, we say that two compound propositions are [[logically equivalent]] if they always have the same value, no matter what truth values are assigned to the [[propositional variable|propositional variables]] that they contain.
