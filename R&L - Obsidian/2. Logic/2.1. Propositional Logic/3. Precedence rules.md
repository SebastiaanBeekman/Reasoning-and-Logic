# Precedence rules
Logical operators can be used in more complicated expressions, such as *p $\wedge$ $\neg$q* or *(p $\vee$ q) $\wedge$ (q $\vee$ r)*. A proposition made up of simpler propositions and logical operators is called a [[compound proposition]]. Just like in mathematics, [[precedence rules]] are used to determine the order of evaluation: 
1. ()
2. $\neg$
3. $\wedge$
4. $\vee$

For example, the expression $\neg$p $\vee$ q $\wedge$ r is equivaltent to the expression ($\neg$p) $\vee$ (q $\wedge$ r). When a compound proposition contains precedence of equal value, it is evaluated from left to right. Thus, the expression p $\wedge$ q $\wedge$ r is equivalent to (p $\wedge$ q) $\wedge$ r rather than to p $\wedge$ (q $\wedge$ r). However, in this particular case, it doesnâ€™t really matter which $\wedge$ operator is evaluated first, since the two compound propositions (p $\wedge$ q) $\wedge$ r and p $\wedge$ (q $\wedge$ r) always have the same value, no matter what logical values the component propositions p, q, and r have. So, we say that $\wedge$ is an [[associative]] operation. 

Every compound proposition has a [[main connective]]. The main connective is the connective that is evaluated last, according to the precedence rules and parentheses. There should be no ambiguity over which is the main connective in a compound proposition.
