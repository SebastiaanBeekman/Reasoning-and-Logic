# Propositions
A propositon is a statement which is either true or false. In propositional logic, we reason only about propositions and see what we can do with them. Since this is mathematics, we use symbolic names, such as p, q and r, to represent propositions. A letter used in this way is called a [[propositional variable]]. Remember that when we say something like “Let p be a proposition”. The discussion has mathematical generality in that p can represent any statement, and the discussion will be valid no matter which statement it represents.
