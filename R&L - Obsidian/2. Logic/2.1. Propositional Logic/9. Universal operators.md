# Universal operators
Any compound proposition that uses any of the operators $\rightarrow$, $\leftrightarrow$, and ⊕ can be rewritten as a logically equivalent proposition that uses only $\wedge$, $\vee$, and $\neg$. It is easy to check that p $\rightarrow$ q is logically equivalent to $\neg$p $\vee$ q, just make a truth table. Similarly, p $\leftrightarrow$ q can be expressed as ($\neg$p $\vee$ q) $\wedge$ ($\neg$q $\vee$ p), So, in a strict logical sense, $\rightarrow$, $\leftrightarrow$, and ⊕ are unnecessary. 

In a strict logical sense, we could even do without the **conjunction operator**. It is easy to check that p $\wedge$ q is logically equivalent to $\neg$($\neg$p $\vee$ $\neg$q), so any expression that uses $\wedge$ can be rewritten as one that uses only $\neg$ and $\vee$. Alternatively, we could do without $\vee$ and write everything in terms of $\neg$ and 
$\wedge$. We call a set of operators that can express all operations: [[functionally complete]]. More formally we would state the following:

### Definition 2.3
A set of logical operators is [[functionally complete]] if and only if all formulas in propositional logic can be rewritten to an equivalent form that uses only operators from the set.
