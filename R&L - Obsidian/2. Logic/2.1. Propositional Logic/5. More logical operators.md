# More logical operators
There are other logical operators beside $\wedge$, $\vee$, and $\neg$. We will consider the [[conditional operator]], $\rightarrow$, the [[biconditional operator]], $\leftrightarrow$, and the [[exclusive or operator]], ⊕. These operators can be completely defined by a truth table that shows their values for the four possible combinations of truth values of p and q.

### Definition 2.2.
For any propositions p and q, we define the propositions p $\rightarrow$ q, p $\leftrightarrow$ q, and p ⊕ q according to the truth table:
| p   | q   | p → q | p ↔ q | p ⊕ q | 
| --- | --- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 0   | 0   | 1     | 1     | 0     |
| 0   | 1   | 1     | 0     | 1     |
| 1   | 0   | 0     | 0     | 1     |
| 1   | 1   | 1     | 1     | 0     |
When these operators are used in expressions, in the absence of parentheses to indicate order of evaluation, we use the following precedence rules:
- The exclusive or operator, ⊕ has the same precedence as $\vee$
- The conditional operator, $\rightarrow$, has lower precedence than $\wedge$, $\vee$, $\neg$, and ⊕
- The biconditional operator, $\leftrightarrow$, has the lowest precedence
