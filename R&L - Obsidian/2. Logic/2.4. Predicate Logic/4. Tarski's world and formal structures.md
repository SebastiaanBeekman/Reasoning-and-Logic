# Tarski's world and formal structures
To help you reason about sets of predicate logic statements, or even arguments expressed in predicate logic, we often use a ‘mathematical structure’. For some of these structures a visualisation in the form of a [[Tarski’s world]] can sometimes be useful.

In a Tarski’s world, it is possible to describe situations using formulas whose truth can be evaluated, which are expressed in a first-order language that uses predicates such as Rightof(x, y), which means that *x* is situated, somewhere, not necessarily directly, to the right of *y*, or Blue(x), which means that *x* is blue. In the world in the figure below, for instance, the formula $\forall$x(Triangle(x) $\rightarrow$ Blue(x)) holds, since all triangles are blue, but the converse of this formula, $\forall$x(Blue(x) $\rightarrow$ Triangle(x)), does not hold, since object c is blue but not a triangle.

Such an instance of Tarski world can be more formally described as a ‘mathematical structure’ . These structures allow us to evaluate statements in predicate logic as being true or false. To formalise a structure, we need to describe two things: the [[domain of discourse]] *D* of the structure and for all of the predicates, for which objects of the domain they are true. We do so using *set-notation*. The formal description of the structure *S* depicted in the figure above is:
- D = {a, b, c, d, e}
• BlueS = {b, c}
• GrayS = {a, d}
• RedS = {e}
• SquareS = {a}
• TriangleS = {b}
• CircleS = {c, d, e}
• RightOf S = {(b, a), (c, a), (d, a), (e, a), (b, c), (d, c), (b, e), (c, e), (d, e)}
• LeftOf S = {(a, b), (c, b), (e, b), (a, c), (e, c), (a, d), (c, d), (e, d), (a, e)}
• BelowOf S = {(a, c), (a, d), (a, e), (b, c), (b, d), (b, e), (c, d), (c, e)}
• AboveOf S = {(c, a), (c, b), (d, a), (d, b), (d, c), (e, a), (e, b), (e, c)}

Notice that for the one-place predicates we have a set of objects for which this predicate is true (e.g., only b and c are blue) and such a set is denoted using ‘{’ and ‘}’ symbols. For the two place predicates we have a set of [[tuple|tuples]] that are denoted using ‘(’ and ‘)’ symbols. In this case, for instance, the fact that *(a, b)* is in the set $LeftOf^S$ means that *LeftOf (a, b)* is true for this structure, i.e., a is left of b.
