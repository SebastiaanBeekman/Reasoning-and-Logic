BJust as the laws of logic allow us to do algebra with logical formulas, the laws of set theory allow us to do algebra with sets. Because of the close relationship between logic and set theory, their algebras are very similar. The algebra of sets, like the algebra of logic, is Boolean algebra. When George Boole wrote his 1854 book about logic, it was really as much about set theory as logic. In fact, Boole did not make a clear distinction between a predicate and the set of objects for which that predicate is true. His algebraic laws and formulas apply equally to both cases. More exactly, if we consider only subsets of some given universal set $\mathcal{U}$, then there is a direct correspondence between the basic symbols and operations of propositional logic and certain symbols and operations in set theory, as shown in this table:

Any valid logical formula or computation involving propositional variables and the symbols $T, F, \wedge, \vee,$ and $\neg$ can be transformed into a valid formula or computation in set theory by replacing the propositions in the formula with subsets of $\mathcal{U}$ and replacing the logical symbols with $\mathcal{U}, \emptyset, \cap, \cup,$ and the complement operator. [[Figure 4.5.png|Figure 4.5]] illustrates.

Just as in logic, the operations of set theory can be combined to form complex expressions such as $(A \cup C) \cap \overline{(B \cup \overline{C} \cup D)}$. Parentheses can always be used in such expressions to specify the order in which the operations are to be performed. In the absence of parentheses, we need precedence rules to determine the order of operation. The precedence rules for the Boolean algebra of sets are carried over directly from the Boolean algebra of propositions. When union and intersection are used together without parentheses, intersection has precedence over union. Furthermore, when several operators of the same type are used without parentheses, then they are evaluated in order from left to right. (Of course, since $\cup$ and $\cap$ are both associative operations, it really doesn’t matter whether the order of evaluation is left-to-right or right-to-left.) For example, $A \cup B \cap C \cup D$ is evaluated as $(A \cup (B \cap C)) \cup D$. The complement operation is a special case. Since it is denoted by drawing a line over its operand, there is never any ambiguity about which part of a formula it applies to.

The laws of set theory can be used to simplify complex expressions involving sets. (As usual, of course, the meaning of ‘simplification’ is partly in the eye of the beholder.) For example, for any sets *X* and *Y*,
$$
\begin{align}
(X \cup Y) \cap (Y\cup X) = (X \cup Y) \cap (X \cup Y) \\
= (X \cup Y)
\end{align}
$$
where in the second step, the Idempotent Law, which says that $A \cap A = A$, is applied with $A = X \cup Y$. For expressions that use the complement operation, it is usually considered to be simpler to apply the operation to an individual set, as in $\overline{A}$, rather than to a formula, as in $\overline{A \cup B}$. DeMorgan’s Laws can always be used to simplify an expression in which the complement operation is applied to a formula. For example,
$$
\begin{align}
A \cap \overline{B \cup \overline{A}} = A \cap (\overline{B} \cap \overline{\overline{A}}) \\
= A \cap (\overline{B} \cap A) \\
= A \cap (A \cap \overline{B}) \\
= (A \cap A) \cap \overline{B} \\
= A \cap \overline{B}
\end{align}
$$
As a final example of the relationship between set theory and logic, consider the set-theoretical expression $A \cap (A \cup B)$ and the corresponding compound proposition $p \wedge (p \vee q)$. (These correspond since for any *x*, $x \in A \cap (A \cup B) \equiv (x \in A) \wedge ((x \in A) \vee (x \in B)))$. You might find it intuitively clear that $A \cap (A \cup B) = A$. Formally, this follows from the fact that $p \wedge (p \vee q) \equiv p$, which might be less intuitively clear and is surprising difficult to prove algebraically from the laws of logic. However, there is another way to check that a logical equivalence is valid: Make a truth table. Consider a truth table for $p \wedge (p \vee q)$:

![[Pasted image 20221024150735.png]]

The fact that the first column and the last column of this table are identical shows that $p \wedge (p \vee q) \equiv p$. Taking p to be the proposition $x \in A$ and q to be the proposition $x \in B$, it follows that the sets *A* and $A \cap (A \cup B)$ have the same members and therefore are equal.
