Generalising from the data structure of a tree, we can create a [[graph]]. In computer science, we can model many different problems as graphs: from shortest paths to help your navigation system, to scheduling sports matches. Think of a graph like a tree, except that there can be edges between ‘sibling’ nodes—and more.
