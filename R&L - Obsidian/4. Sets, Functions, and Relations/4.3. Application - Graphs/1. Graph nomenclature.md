A graph is a 2-tuple of two sets often denoted as *G = (V, E)*. The first coordinate *V* is a set of [[vertices]], also called [[nodes]]. The second coordinate *E* is a set of [[edges]], where each edge represents a connection between two vertices. Two vertices connected by an edge are called [[neighbours]]. Graphically, we often draw vertices as circles with edges as lines between them, as we did for trees in the last chapter. For example consider the following visual representation of a graph $G_1$:

This graph can also be expressed more formally as:
$$
G_1 = (\{s, a, b, t\}, \{\{s, t\}, \{s, b\}, \{a, b\}, \{b, t\}\})
$$
This graph is what we call [[undirected]], by which we mean that edges do not have a direction. As a result we represent the edges as sets meaning $E \subseteq \{\{v_1, v_2\} | v_1 \neq v_2 \wedge v_1, v_2 \in V\}$. In contrast in a [[directed graph]], edges have an origin and a destination. Consider now graph $G_2$:

This graph can be expressed as a 2-tuple as:
$$
G_2 = (\{s, a, b, t\}, \{(s, t), (s, b), (a, b), (b, t)\})
$$Notice that for directed graphs it holds that $E \subseteq V Ã— V$. Finally we define a [[path]] as a sequence of some edges. For example a path $\pi = ((s, b), (b, t))$ denotes a path from *s* to *t* in the graph $G_2$ above.

In [[Section 4.5.5]] we will revisit this model for graphs and explore what the addition of functions can do to enrich our graph model.
