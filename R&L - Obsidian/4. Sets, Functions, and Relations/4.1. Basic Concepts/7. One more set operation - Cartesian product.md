If A and B are sets, then we can form the set A × B which is defined by
$$
A\ X\ B = \{(a,b)|a \in A and b \in B\}
$$
This set is called the [[cross product]] or [[Cartesian product]] of the sets *A* and *B*. The set $A\ ×\ B$ contains every ordered pair whose first coordinate is an element of *A* and whose second coordinate is an element of *B*. For example, if $X = \{c, d\}$ and $Y = \{1, 2, 3\}$, then $X\ ×\ Y = \{(c, 1), (c, 2), (c, 3), (d, 1), (d, 2), (d, 3)\}$.

It is possible to extend this idea to the cross product of more than two sets. The cross product of the three sets *A*, *B*, and *C* is denoted $A\ ×\ B\ ×\ C$ and produced ordered triples $(a, b, c)$ where $a \in A, b \in B, c \in C$. Another example can be found in the homework duos you have formed for this course. Each of these pairs of students is a 2-tuple, from the set $S\ ×\ S$ where *S* is the set of students currently taking Reasoning & Logic.
