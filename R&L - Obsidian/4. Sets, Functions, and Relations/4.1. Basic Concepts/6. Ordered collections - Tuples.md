# Ordered collections - Tuples
If *a* and *b* are entities, then *(a, b)* denotes the [[ordered pair]] containing *a* and *b*. The ordered pair *(a, b)* differs from the set *{a, b}* because a set is not ordered. That is, *{a, b}* and *{b, a}* denote the same set, but if a $\neq$ b, then *(a, b)* and *(b, a)* are different ordered pairs. More generally, two ordered pairs *(a, b)* and *(c, d)* are equal if and only if both a = c and b = d. If *(a, b)* is an ordered pair, then *a* and *b* are referred to as the [[coordinates]] of the ordered pair. In particular, *a* is the first coordinate and *b* is the second coordinate.

You can extend this concept to more than just pairs. With three elements we can create [[ordered triples]] *(a, b, c)*. The definition for four or more coordinates is similar. The general term for such an ordered collection is [[tuple]] or, more specifically, [[ordered n-tuple]]. For example, *(a, b, c, d, e)* is an ordered 5-tuple.
