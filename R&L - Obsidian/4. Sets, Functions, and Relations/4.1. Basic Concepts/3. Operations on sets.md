# Operations on sets
Now that we have a way to express a wide variety of sets, we turn to operations that can be performed on sets. The most basic operations on sets are [[union]] and [[intersection]]. If *A* and *B* are sets, then we define the union of *A* and *B* to be the set that contains all the elements of *A* together with all the elements of *B*. The union of *A* and *B* is denoted by *A* $\cup$ *B*. The union can be defined formally as
$$
A \cup B = \{x|x\in A\vee x\in B\}
$$
The intersection of *A* and *B* is defined to be the set that contains every entity that is both a member of *A* and a member of *B*. The intersection of *A* and *B* is denoted by *A* $\cap$ *B*. Formally,
$$
A \cap B = \{x|x\in A\wedge x\in B\}
$$
An entity gets into *A* $\cup$ *B* if it is in *either* *A* or *B*. It gets into *A* $\cap$ *B* if it is in *both* *A* and *B*. Note that the symbol for the logical ‘or’ operator, $\vee$, is similar to the symbol for the union operator, $\cup$, while the logical ‘and’ operator, $\wedge$, is similar to the intersection operator, $\cap$.

The [[set difference]] of two sets, *A* and *B*, is defined to be the set of all entities that are members of *A* but are not members of *B*. The set difference of *A* and *B* is denoted *A* $\setminus$ *B* or alternatively as *A* − *B*. The idea is that *A* $\setminus$ *B* is formed by starting with *A* and then removing any element that is also found in *B*. Formally,
$$
A \setminus B = \{x|x\in A\wedge x\notin B\}
$$
Union and intersection are clearly commutative operations. That is, *A* $\cup$ *B* = *B* $\cup$ *A* and 
*A* $\cap$ *B* = *B* $\cap$ *A* for any sets *A* and *B*. However, set difference is not commutative. In general, *A* $\setminus$ *B*  $\neq$ *B* $\setminus$ *A*.

### Example 1
Suppose that $A = \{a, b, c\}$, that $B = \{b, d\}$, and that $C = \{d, e, f\}$. Then we can apply the definitions of union, intersection, and set difference to compute, for example, that:
$$
\begin{align}
A\cup B = \{a,b,c,d\} \\
A\cup C = \{a,b,c,d,e,f\}\\ 
A\cap B = \{b\} \\ 
A\cap C = \emptyset \\
A\setminus B = \{a,c\} \\
A\setminus C = \{a,b,c\} \\
\end{align}
$$
In this example, the sets *A* and *C* have no elements in common, so that $A \cap C = \emptyset$. There is a term for this: Two sets are said to be [[disjoint]] if they have no elements in common. That is, for any sets *A* and *B*, *A* and *B* are said to be disjoint if and only if $A \cap B = \emptyset$.

Of course, the set operations can also be applied to sets that are defined by predicates. The next example illustrates this.

### Example 2
let L(x) be the predicate ‘x is lucky’, and letW(x) be the predicate ‘x is wise’, where the domain of discourse for each predicate is the set of people. Let X = {x | L(x)}, and let Y = {x |W(x)}. Then
$$
\begin{align}
X \cup Y = \{x|L(x) \vee W(x)\} = \{people\ who\ are\ lucky\ or\ wise\} \\
X \cap Y = \{x|L(x) \wedge W(x)\} = \{people\ who\ are\ lucky\ and\ wise\} \\
X \setminus Y = \{x|L(x) \vee \neg W(x)\} = \{people\ who\ are\ lucky\ but\ not\ wise\} \\
Y \setminus X = \{x|W(x) \vee \neg L(x)\} = \{people\ who\ are\ wise\ but\ not\ lucky\} \\
\end{align}
$$
