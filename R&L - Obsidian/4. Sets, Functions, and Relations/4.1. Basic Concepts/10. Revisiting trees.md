In [[Trees|Chapter 3.8]] we defined trees very informally. Now that we know about tuples and recursive sets, we can formally define the set of trees *TREE* as follows:

**Empty Tree** $\emptyset \in$ *TREE*
**Leaf Nodes** $(x,\emptyset) \in$ *TREE* if $x \in D$
**Internal Nodes** $(x, (T_1, T_2, . . . , T_k)) \in$ *TREE* if $x \in D \wedge \forall i(1 \leq i \leq k \rightarrow T_i \in TREE)$ for some integer k
**Exclusivity** Nothing else is in *TREE*

Note that in this definition we have included a free variable *D*. This is the *domain* of values that are allowed in the tree. For example for our parse trees from [[2. An application of trees|Chapter 3.8.2]] we could use $D = R \cup \{+,−, /, ∗\}$.

This way we can have the following tree be formally represented as:
$$
(∗, ((+, ((8,\emptyset), (3,\emptyset))), (/, ((10,\emptyset), (5,\emptyset)))))
$$
You can probably see now why we often choose to represent trees visually!

Note that we could alternatively have represented our leaf node 8 as (8, ($\emptyset$)). After all, one could argue this also describe a node without any children containing values. However, this description describes a different tree. After all it now says that the node 8 has a child (and thus is an internal node), but that this child has no value (it is an empty tree). To visualise this, other authors sometimes use squares as such:

Notice also how we can now ‘easily’ define binary trees by simply limiting $k = 2$ in the Internal Nodes rule. For example $(8, ((3, (\emptyset, (2,\emptyset))),\emptyset))$ would be a binary tree, represented like this:

But have you spotted an unfortunate side effect of this definition? In our visualisation, both our squares and our node containing 2 are considered leaves. After all they have no children! As a result, some books instead use the following definition for binary trees. This removes the ambiguity on the definition of a leaf, but as a downside does not allow any leaf to have a value. It is a nice example of one of the many trade-offs in computer science.

**Leaf Nodes** $\emptyset \in$ *BTREE*
**Internal Nodes** $(x, (T_1, T_2)) \in$ *BTREE* if $x \in D \wedge T_1, T_2 \in$ *BTREE*
**Exclusivity** Nothing else is in *BTREE*

Now that we have formalised our definition of binary trees, we can also start proving interesting properties about them. One such property is that the number of leaves of a binary tree $n_L \leq 2^h$ where *h* is the height of the tree. A proof for this claim can now follow our structural induction format as outlined in the previous section:

**Proof.**
**Base case (Empty Tree)**:
Consider the Empty Tree rule of the definition of *TREE*. The empty tree has no nodes, so a height of 0 and also no leaves. Hence $n_L = 0 \leq 2^0 = 1$ holds.

**Base case (Leaf Nodes)**:
Consider the Leaf Nodes rule of the definition of *TREE*. A leaf node has a height of 0 as longest path from a leaf to the root excluding the leaf has no nodes (there are no nodes except the leaf!), hence $n_L = 1 \leq 20 = 1$ holds.

**Inductive case (Internal Nodes):**
Let $T_1$ and $T_2$ be some trees with $n_{L1}$ and n_{L2} as their number of leaves and $h_1$ and $h_2$ as their heights respectively. Now assume that $n_{L1} \leq 2^{h1}$ and $n_{L2} \leq 2^h_2$ (IH). Now we use the Internal Nodes rule to create a new Tree $T = (x, (T_1, T_2))$ for some value *x*. For this tree *T*, $n_L = n_{L1} + n_{L2}$ and the height $h = max(h_1, h_2) + 1$. Now we use a division into cases:
- $h_1 \gt h_2$ In this case it follows that $n_{L2} \leq 2^{h2} \lt 2^{h1}$ . As a result: $n_L = n_{L1} + n_{L2} \lt 2 · 2^{h1} = 2^{h1+1} = 2^{max(h_1,h_2)+1}$.
- $h_1 = h_2$ In this case it follows that $n_{L2} \leq 2^{h2} = 2^{h1}$ . As a result: $nL = n_{L1} + n_{L2} \leq 2 · 2^{h1} = 2^{h1+1} = 2^{max(h_1,h_2)+1}$.
- $h_1 \lt h_2$ Is analogous to the first case.
Now we have shown that the property holds for all rules of *TREE* where $k = 2$ in the internal nodes rule. This completes the proof by structural induction.
**QED.**
