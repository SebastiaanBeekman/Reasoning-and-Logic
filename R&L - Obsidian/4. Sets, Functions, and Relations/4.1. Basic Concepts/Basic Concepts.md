A [[set]] is a collection of [[elements]]. A set is defined entirely by the elements that it contains. An element can be anything, including another set. You will notice that this is not a precise mathematical definition. Instead, it is an intuitive description of what the word ‘set’ is supposed to mean: any time you have a bunch of entities and you consider them as a unit, you have a set. Mathematically, sets are really defined by the operations that can be performed on them. These operations model things that can be done with collections of objects in the real world. These operations are the subject of the branch of mathematics known as [[set theory]].

The most basic operation in set theory is forming a set from a given list of specific entities. The set that is formed in this way is denoted by enclosing the list of entities between a left brace, ‘{’, and a right brace, ‘}’. The entities in the list are separated by commas. For example, the set denoted by
$$
\{17, \pi, New\  York, King\ Willem-Alexander, Euromast\}
$$
is the set that contains the entities 17, $\pi$, New York City, King Willem-Alexander,
and Euromast. These entities are the elements of the set. [[Figure 4.1.png| Figure 4.1]] is an abstract depiction this set.

Since we assume that a set is completely defined by the elements that it contains, the set is well-defined. Of course, we still haven’t said what it means to be an ‘entity’. Something as definite as ‘New York City’ should qualify, except that it doesn’t seem like New York City really belongs in the world of mathematics. The problem is that mathematics is supposed to be its own self-contained world, but it is supposed to model the real world. When we use mathematics to model the real world, we admit entities such as New York City and even Euromast. But when we are doing mathematics *per se*, we’ll generally stick to obviously mathematical entities such as the integer 17 or the real number $\pi$. We will also use letters such as *a* and *b* to refer to entities. For example, when we say something like “Let *A* be the set $\{a, b, c\}$”, we mean *a*, *b*, and *c* to be particular, but unspecified, entities.
