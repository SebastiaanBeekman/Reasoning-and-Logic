In mathematics, of course, we need to work with functional relationships in the abstract. To do this, we introduce the idea of [[function]]. You should think of a function as a mathematical object that expresses a functional relationship between two sets. The notation $f : A \rightarrow B$ expresses the fact that f is a function from the set A to the set B. That is, f is a name for a mathematical object that expresses a functional relationship from the set A to the set B. The notation $f : A \rightarrow B$ is read as “ f is a function from *A* to *B*” or more simply as “ f maps *A* to *B*”.

If $f : A \rightarrow B$ and if $a \in A$, the fact that *f* is a functional relationship from *A* to *B* means that *f* associates some element of *B* to *a*. That element is denoted $f(a)$. That is, for each $a \in A$, $f(a)$ $\in$ *B* and $f(a)$ is the single, definite answer to the question “What element of *B* is associated to a by the function *f*?” The fact that *f* is a function from *A* to B means that this question has a single, well-defined answer. Given $a \in A$, $f(a)$ is called the value of the function f at a.

It is in the form of formulas such as $s(n) = n^2$ or $f(x) = x^3 −3x +7$ that most people first encounter functions. But you should note that a formula by itself is not a function, although it might well specify a function between two given sets of numbers. Functions are much more general than formulas, and they apply to all kinds of sets, not just to sets of numbers.
