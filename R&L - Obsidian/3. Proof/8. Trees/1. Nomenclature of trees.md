# Nomenclature of trees
Trees in the mathematical world are often drawn in the opposite direction compared to real-world trees, with the root of the tree at the top. Why? Maybe because most people write from top of page downwards. The root has zero or more children nodes that each form the root of a subtree. Consider for example the following tree:

Nodes are represented by circles. The nodes of a tree can contain any type of data, but we will in this example each node contains an integer. The [[node]] containing 8 is the root of this tree, with 42 and 17 being its children. Both 42 and 17 are root of subtrees. For example, the subtree rooted in 17 has three nodes: 17 as the root with its children 7 and 20. Nodes with no children are called [[leaf]] nodes. In our example tree, the leaf nodes are 42, 7 and 20.

We will formalise this structure when we learn about sets and relations in the next chapter, but for now we will settle for the following informal definition:

### Definition 3.1
(Tree node (informal)). A node in a tree has a) a value, b) a list of nodes.

There are many more names used in a description of a tree, and some of these might vary a bit between textbooks. In this, we use the following set of terminology:
- **Parent of x** - The node in whose list of nodes x occurs
- **Siblings of x** - The other nodes in the list of children of xâ€™s parent
- **Descendents of x** - x and the descendants of the children of x
- **Ancestors of x** - x and the ancestors of the parent of x
- **Leaf** - A node that has no children
- **Root** - The node that has no parent
- **Binary tree** - A tree where every node has at most 2 children
- **Height** - The largest number of vertices on a path from a leaf to the root, excluding the leaf

Using this terminology, we can now say that the example tree above has a height of 2, contains 3 leaves, and is a binary tree. Further, the ancestors of 20 are 20 itself, 17 and 8.
