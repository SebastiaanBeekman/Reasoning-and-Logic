# An application of trees
Trees are popular in computer science because they can be used for a large number of different applications, from sorting, to memory management and keeping track of family members. Trees are a special type of a more general linked data structure, graphs, which are also very useful in computer science. We’ll look at graphs in the next chapter.

For now we will only take a look at one example, using trees to represent mathematical formulae. Consider for example the expression: (8 + 3) ∗ (10 / 5). We can represent this using a tree, by having every operator be the root of a subtree, and the leaves of the tree be the different numbers:

Notice how this tree has different types of 'data' in its nodes: some are numbers and some are operators.

You will find that for each of these trees there is exactly one expression that matches it! For example, the following tree represents the statement: -$\frac{x+8}{(x+1)(y-1)} - 2$

If you already have some programming experience, perhaps you can already see how this could be a useful way to represent mathematical expressions. We can now write a recursive algorithm that first evaluates the value of the children, and then applies the operator at the root of the subtree. Simply put:
1. If this node is a number, return the number 
2. Else evaluate the value of each child
3. Combine the values using the operator in this node
