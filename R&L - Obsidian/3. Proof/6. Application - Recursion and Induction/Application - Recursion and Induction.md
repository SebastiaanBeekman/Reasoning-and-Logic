# Application: Recursion and Induction
In computer programming, there is a technique called [[recursion]] that is closely related to induction. In a computer program, a [[subroutine]] is a named sequence of instructions for performing a certain task. When that task needs to be performed in a program, the subroutine can be [[called]] by name. A typical way to organize a program is to break down a large task into smaller, simpler subtasks by calling subroutines to perform each of the subtasks. A subroutine can perform its task by calling other subroutines to perform subtasks of the overall task. A subroutine can also call itself. That is, in the process of performing some large task, a subroutine can call itself to
perform a subtask. This is known as recursion, and a subroutine that does this is said to be a [[recursive subroutine]]. Recursion is appropriate when a large task can be broken into subtasks where some or all of the subtasks are smaller, simpler versions of the main task.
