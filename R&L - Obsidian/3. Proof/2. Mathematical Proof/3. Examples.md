# Examples
Let’s look now at another example of a proof. We set out to prove that the
sum of any two rational numbers is rational.

*Proof*. We start by assuming that x and y are arbitrary rational numbers.
Here’s a formal proof that the inference rule
- x is rational
- y is rational
- $\therefore$ x + y is rational

is a valid rule of interence:

So the rule of inference given above is valid. Since x and y are arbitrary
rationals, we have proved that the rule is valid for all rationals, and hence
the sum of any two rationals is rational.

Again, a more informal presentation that we expect from you during the
course would look like:

*Proof*. Proof by generalisation:
- Let *x* and *y* be arbitrary rational numbers
- By the definition of rational, there are integers *a*, *b* $\neq$ 0, *c*, *d* $\neq$ 0 such that *x* = $\frac{a}{b}$ and *y* = $\frac{c}{d}$
- Then x + y = $\frac{ad + bc}{bd}$;
- We know *ad* + *bc* and *bd* are integers since the sum and product of integers are integers, and we also know *bd* $\neq$ 0 since neither *b* nor *d* is 0
- So we have written x + y as the ratio of two integers, the denominator being non-zero
- Therefore, by the definition of rational numbers, x + y is rational
- Since x and y were arbitrary rationals, the sum of any two rationals is rational
