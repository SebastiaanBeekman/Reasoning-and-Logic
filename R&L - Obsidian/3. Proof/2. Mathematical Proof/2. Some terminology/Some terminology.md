# Some terminology
Before we look at some sample proofs, here is some terminology that we will use throughout our sample proofs and the rest of the course of *Reasoning & Logic*.
- The [[natural numbers]] (denoted $\mathbb{N}$) are the numbers 0, 1, 2, . . .. Note that the sum and product of natural numbers are natural numbers
- The [[integers]] (denoted $\mathbb{Z}$) are the numbers 0,−1, 1,−2, 2,−3, 3, ... Note
that the sum, product, and difference of integers are integers
- The [[rational numbers]] (denoted $\mathbb{Q}$) are all numbers that can be written in the form $\frac{m}{n}$ where m and n are integers and n $\neq$ 0. Note that the sum, product, difference, and quotient of rational numbers are rational numbers (provided you don’t attempt to divide by 0)
- The [[real numbers]] (denoted $\mathbb{R}$) are numbers that can be written in decimal form, possibly with an infinite number of digits after the decimal point
- The [[irrational numbers]] are real numbers that are not rational, i.e., that cannot be written as a ratio of integers. Such numbers include $\sqrt{3}$ and $\pi$
- An integer n is **divisible by** *m* [[iff]] n = mk for some integer k. This can also be expressed by saying that m evenly divides n, which has the mathematical notation m | n. So for example, 2 | 8, but 8 ∤ 2. 2 | n [[iff]] n = 2k for some integer k; n is divisible by 3 [[iff]] n = 3k for some integer k, and so on. Note that if 2 ∤ n (i.e., n is *not* divisible by 2), then n must be 1 more than a multiple of 2 so n = 2k + 1 for some integer k. Similarly, if n is not divisible by 3 then n must be 1 or 2 more than a multiple of 3, so n = 3k + 1 or n = 3k + 2 for some integer k
- An integer is [[even]] iff it is divisible by 2 and [[odd]] [[iff]] it is not.
- An integer n > 1 is [[prime]] if it is divisible by exactly two positive integers, namely 1 and itself. Note that a number must be greater than 1 to even have a chance of being termed ‘prime’. In particular, neither 0 nor 1 is prime.
