Let’s look at a few examples.

### Theorem 3.5
The number $2^{2n}$ − 1 is divisible by 3 for all [[natural numbers]] n.

**Proof**. Here, P(n) is the statement that $2^{2n}$ − 1 is divisible by 3.
**Base case**: When n = 0, $2^{2n}$ − 1 = $2^0$ − 1 = 1 − 1 = 0 and 0 is divisible by 3. Therefore the statement holds when n = 0.
**Inductive case**: We want to show that if the statement is true for n = k (where k is an arbitrary natural number), then it is also true for n = k + 1. That is, we must prove the implication P(k) $\rightarrow$ P(k+1). So we assume P(k), that is, we assume that $2^{2k}$ is divisible by 3. This means that $2^{2k}$ − 1 = 3m for some integer m. We want to prove P(k + 1), that is, that $2^{2(k+1)}$ − 1 is also divisible by 3:

Altogether, we have proved that P(0) holds and that, for all k, P(k) $\rightarrow$ P(k +1) is true. Therefore, by the principle of induction, P(n) is true for all n in N, i.e. $2^{2n}$ − 1 is divisible by 3 for all n in $\mathbb{N}$.

The principle of mathematical induction gives a method for proving P(n) for all n in the set $\mathbb{N}$. It should be clear that if M is any natural number, a similar method can be used to show that P(n) is true for all natural numbers n that satisfy n $\geq$ M. Just start the induction with a base case of n = M instead of with a base case of n = 0. We leave the proof of this extension of the principle of induction as an exercise.

### Theorem 3.6
Suppose that a compound proposition contains exactly n propositional variables, where n $\geq$ 1. Then there are exactly $2^n$ different ways of assigning truth values to the n variables.

**Poorf**. Let P(n) be the statement “There are exactly $2^n$ different ways of assigning truth values to n propositional variables.” We will use induction to prove the P(n) is true for all n $\geq$ 1.
**Base case**: First, we prove the statement P(1). If there is exactly one variable, then there are exactly two ways of assigning a truth value to that variable. Namely, the variable can be either true or false. Since 2 = $2^1$, P(1) is true.
**Inductive case**: Suppose that P(k) is already known to be true. We want to prove that, under this assumption, P(k +1) is also true. Suppose that $p_1$, $p_2$, …, $p_{k+1}$ are k + 1 propositional variables. Since we are assuming that P(k) is true, we know that there are $2^k$ ways of assigning truth values to $p_1$, $p_2$, …, $p_k$. But each assignment of truth values to $p_1$, $p_2$, …, $p_k$ can be extended to the complete list $p_1$, $p_2$, …, pk, $p_{k+1}$ in two ways. Namely, $p_{k+1}$ can be assigned the value true or the value false. It follows that there are 2 · $2^k$ ways of assigning truth values to $p_1$, $p_2$, …, $p_{k+1}$. Since 2 · $2^k$ = $2^{k+1}$,
this finishes the proof.
