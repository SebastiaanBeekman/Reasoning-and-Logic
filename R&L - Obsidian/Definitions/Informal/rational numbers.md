# Rational numbers
The **rational numbers** (denoted $\mathbb{Q}$) are all numbers that can be written in the form $\frac{m}{n}$ where m and n are integers and n $\neq$ 0. 

So $\frac{1}{3}$ and $\frac{-65}{7}$ are rationals. Less obvious numbers are 6 and $\frac{\sqrt{27}}{\sqrt{12}}$ since 6 = $\frac{6}{1}$ (or, for that matter, 6 =$\frac{−12}{−2}$), and $\frac{\sqrt{27}}{\sqrt{12}}$ = $\sqrt{\frac{27}{12}}$ = $\sqrt{\frac{9}{4}}$ = $\frac{3}{2}$. 

Note the restriction that the number in the denominator cannot be 0: 30 is not a number at all, rational or otherwise; it is an undefined quantity. Note also that the sum, product, difference, and quotient of rational numbers are rational numbers (provided you don’t attempt to divide by 0)
