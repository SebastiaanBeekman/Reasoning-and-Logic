# Definition 2.7
A one-place predicate associates a proposition with each entity in some collection of entities. This collection is called the domain of discourse for the predicate. If P is a predicate and a is an entity in the domain of discourse for P, then P(a) denotes the proposition that is associated
with a by P. We say that P(a) is the result of applying P to a.
