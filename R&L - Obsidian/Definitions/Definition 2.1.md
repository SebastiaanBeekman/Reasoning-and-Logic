# Definition 2.1
Let *p* and *q* be propositions. Then *p $\vee$ q*, *p $\wedge$ q*, and $\neg$p are propositions, whose truth values are given by the rules:
- p $\wedge$ q is true when both p is true and q is true, and in no other case
- p $\vee$ q is true when either p is true, or q is true, or both p and q are true, and in no other case
- $\neg$p is true when p is false, and in no other case
