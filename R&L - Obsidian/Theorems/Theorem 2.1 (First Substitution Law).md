# Theorem 2.1 (First Substitution Law)
Suppose that Q is any proposition, and that p is a propositional variable. Consider any tautology. If (Q) is substituted for p in all places where p occurs in the tautology, then the result is also a tautology.

Since logical equivalence is defined in terms of tautology, it is also true that when (Q) is substituted for p in a logical equivalence, the result is again a logical equivalence.
